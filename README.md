# YARA-Sleuth 🔍
### Advanced File System Scanner for Digital Forensics by St3gX

A modular, multi-threaded digital forensics engine designed to detect malware indicators and data exfiltration artifacts using advanced YARA pattern matching and file entropy analysis.

Note: The reports/ directory is generated automatically during the first scan. It is excluded from the repository via .gitignore to ensure data privacy and prevent the accidental upload of forensic artifacts.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Basic scan
python yara_sleuth.py --target ./sample_files

# Scan entire directory recursively
python yara_sleuth.py --target /home/user/Documents

# Use custom rule directory
python yara_sleuth.py --target ./suspicious_dir --rules ./custom_rules

# Non-recursive scan (current directory only)
python yara_sleuth.py --target ./folder --no-recursive

# Skip JSON report
python yara_sleuth.py --target ./folder --no-json
```

| Component         | Class              | Responsibility                              |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Rule Loader       | `RuleLoader`       | Compiles all `.yar` files into memory        |
| File Metadata     | `FileMetadata`     | Extracts MD5, SHA-256, timestamps, perms    |
| YARA Scanner      | `YARAScanner`      | Matches rules against file content          |
| FS Walker         | `FileSystemWalker` | Recursive traversal with live spinner       |
| Report Generator  | `ReportGenerator`  | Colored terminal + JSON + text reports      |
| Orchestrator      | `YARASleuth`       | Ties all components together                |

## 📊 Output

**Terminal Output** — Color-coded by severity (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)  
**JSON Report** — Full structured output in `reports/yara_sleuth_TIMESTAMP.json`  
**Text Report** — Human-readable report in `reports/yara_sleuth_TIMESTAMP.txt`

---

## 🔧 Adding Custom Rules

Create a `.yar` file in the `yara_rules/` folder:

```yara
rule My_Custom_Rule {
    meta:
        description = "My detection rule"
        severity = "HIGH"
        category = "custom"
        author = "Your Name"
    strings:
        $s1 = "suspicious_string" nocase
    condition:
        any of them
}
```
